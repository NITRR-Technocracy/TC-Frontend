        <h3> META01 : The challenge of phosphorus reduction in steel produced directly from DRI through induction root. </h3>
        In the current era of research, focusing on green technologies as a consequence, the consumption of fossil fuels in the production of steel is disregarded. So, the use of DRI directly induction melting becomes found to be a new root in steel production, however, the scope of dephosphorization of molten steel in induction melting root is limited. To assure good quality and to compete for the international market it is necessary to achieve a phosphorus level of steel should be less than 0.03%. An Innovative process root to produce low phosphorus quality steel using an induction furnace and DRI is a challenging problem of the day. So, your task is to suggest suitable alternatives to Blast furnace root for large-scale High-quality steel production.

        <h3> META05 : Enhancing Consistency of Sinter Characteristics for Economical Pig Iron Production. </h3>
        A steel manufacturer produces pig iron through blast furnace roots. The major raw materials used are iron ore, limestone/dolomite, and coke. A company observes that due to the lack of supply of good quality ore and iron ore and associated hike in the prices of these raw materials resultant pig iron production is uneconomical. The company also found as an alternative they find that iron ore is found at low prices. therefore, they dic=scide the iron ore fine in the form of a sinter with the appreciation that the use of a sinter in a blast furnace increases the rate of production, reduces the coke rate, and thus reduces the production cost. The company started using ore fines by setting up a new sinter plant. Input to the sinter plant or iron ore fines, lime and dolomite fines, coke breeze, mill scale, quick lime, black furnace return, cold sinter return, hot sinter return, and flue dust. The company has performed several trials to get the required properties of sinter, but they have observed that the sinters produced in their sinter plant have irregular characteristics (measured by basicity ratio ((CaO%+MgO%)/(SiO_2%)), tumbling index (TI) and reduction degradation index (RDI) even after maintaining uniform operational parameter. The details of compositional and sinter property data obtained during these trials are available if required You as a Metallurgical Engineer suggests a suitable reason for fixing the irregularity of the sinter characteristics that can be used for the production of pig iron through the blast furnace route.

        <h3> META07 : Propose an automated quality control system for surface defects in continuous steel rolling using advanced imaging and machine learning technologies </h3>
        During the rolling of long flat products in continuous and semi-continuous mills, few surface defects such as central bursting, oxide entrapment, surface crack, or frequently conserved defects. In continuous production lines, these defects impact the productivity and quality of the rolled steel. In conventional methods, the problems are identified by visual inspection and discarding the defective part interrupting the quelling of the long product. The industry is looking for an automatic process for this quality control activity. Suggest a suitable automotive-controlled system using the latest imaging and machine learning technologies
