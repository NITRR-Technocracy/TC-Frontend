        <h3> ECE01 : Smart Traffic & Transit Optimization System </h3>
        Design a hardware and software based smart traffic monitoring system to optimize traffic flow and public transportation efficiency, reduce congestion in urban areas as well as to reduce accidents.
        <br />• Controls traffic lights based on the density of traffic. 
        <br />• Image processing techniques can be used. 
        <br />• System will count the number of vehicles at each lane and give time accordingly to that lane.

        <h3> ECE02 : Automated Pool Cleaning Robot with Water Quality Monitoring </h3>
        Design a pool cleaning robot that not only cleans the pool surfaces but also monitors water quality, ensuring safe and pristine swimming conditions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <h3> ECE03 : Automated Greenhouse System </h3>
        Design an automated greenhouse system that leverages advanced sensors, actuators, and control algorithms to optimize and maintain ideal environmental conditions for the cultivation of various plants. The system should monitor and regulate factors such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil moisture, pH of soil light, CO2 level and air quality to ensure optimal growth and yield. Additionally, the solution should incorporate remote monitoring and control capabilities, enabling users to adjust settings and receive real-time updates to facilitate efficient management and cultivation within the greenhouse environment.

        <h3> ECE07 : Smart Crop Monitoring Drone </h3>
        Create a drone equipped with sensors and camera which monitor real-time data and analysis to provide insights into crop health, growth patterns, identify pests, and optimize agricultural practices. The data collected by the drone should be transmitted in real-time to the farmer's computer or mobile device.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <h3> ECE08 : Water Quality Monitoring via Robotic Fish </h3>
        Design and develop a cost effective and automated system that can collect water quality parameters in real-time, contributing to timely pollution detection and informed decision-making for water resource management and conservation which can be used for large water bodies like for rivers, lakes and oceans.
    </p>

        <h3> ECE10 : Smart Lighting Control System </h3>
        Develop a hardware and software based smart lighting system that adjusts brightness based on real-time traffic flow and pedestrian presence to save energy. (Which can be used for street lights, industries as well as households.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <h3> ECE11 : Smart Pollutant Guard </h3>
        Create a wearable environmental monitoring device that integrates electronic sensors to measure personal exposure to pollutants and harmful substances. The device should communicate with smartphones or other devices to provide users with real-time information about their surroundings, enabling them to make informed decisions and take necessary precautions to safeguard their health and well-being in polluted environments.
